1. when doing binary search while loop condition (left < right)
--> return mid -->
--> left = mid + 1;
--> right = mid;
can guarantee finding a solution

2. when creating new Comparator in order to correct get compare max and min
need to use override compare function say descending: (b - a) to b.compareTo(a)
