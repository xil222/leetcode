1. when doing binary search while loop condition (left < right)
--> return mid -->
--> left = mid + 1;
--> right = mid;
can guarantee finding a solution

2. when creating new Comparator in order to correct get compare max and min
need to use override compare function say descending: (b - a) to b.compareTo(a)

3. another way to set up binary search when not necessary find (left < right)
when find left don't satisfy but could only set left = mid
do check mid + 1 satisfy, then do left = mid + 1.
then we got cases for mid, (only set left = mid) left = mid + 1, right = mid - 1.
